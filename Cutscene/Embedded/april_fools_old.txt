msg	One day, a huge battleship crash landed outside the Griffin base... And that's what we're going with.
/Kalina	Commander, it seems to be a neutral party. And according to FN-57, they've been here before?
/Commander	Before? I don't remember that.
/Kalina	We were away at the time. Supposedly someone named Kiana took over temporarily. We still have her T-Doll.
/Commander	We do? I've never seen a T-Doll named Kiana.
/Kalina	Well, we do have over 500 unique dolls. We're bound to miss a few.
/Commander	...I guess.

/???	Um, hello? Sorry, it seems like our ship has crash landed here after some Honkai interference and the power is nonfunctional. Can we please use the tools at your base?
/Commander	Kalina, am I talking to a twelve year old?
/???	I'm over sixty, for your information!
/Commander	...Whatever. Sure.

/Kiana	Wow, this place is full of girls! Wait, who is that?
/Kiana(?)	I'm Kiana Kaslana. Or to be more precise, I'm a T-Doll based on you. Don't you remember me?
/Kiana	No? You look kind of... Different.
/Kiana(?)	I don't have blue hair, but those handguns...

/M16A1	So you love Jack Daniels too? That's awesome, I bet we'll get along just fine!
/Himeko	Right, right! So, what's your job?
/M16A1	Taking care of my sisters, going on missions, sometimes I get to sit around and do nothing.
/Himeko	I'm a teacher. Well, I'm supposed to be.

/Sin Mal	And I thought one Seele and Bronya was enough of a hassle. Now there's three Bronyas?!
/PP-90	Er, I'm not Bronya... My name is PP-90. Why the heck did Vector drag me here, anyways?
/Seele(?)	This Seele seems... Timid.
/Seele	Huh?
/Sin Mal	Hmm, do I sense murderous intent? Hey, let's fight!
/Bronya	She's an android, Sin. She'd kill you.
/Sin Mal	No way! I can take her!
/Bronya	...I won't stop you from chasing your own death.
/PP-90	Is that really okay? You know she has a massive scythe, right? And she's pretty violent.
/Seele	Sin Mal's too stubborn to die. That's just how she is.
/Sin Mal	Heaven or hell, let's rock!

/Kyuushou	Oh, a video game? Can I play it?
/Dier	Erm... Sure?
/Dandelion
