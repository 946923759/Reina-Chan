speaker	Gr MP5
msg	/hl[0]Um... I do not know where she is. Maybe she is hiding herself?

msgboxTransition 
speaker	WA2000
msg	/hl[0]W-Why would I be?! Besides, I was born to fight. It's only natural that I'm not good with words!

msgboxTransition 
speaker	WA2000

msgboxTransition 
speaker	WA2000
msg	/hl[0]Oh... Chocolate ice cream? As expected of G36. She knows me.
msg	But don't you dare tell a soul... WA2000 loves ice cream? What a joke.
msgboxTransition 
speaker	Gr MP5
msg	/hl[1]Um... I am very sorry...
msg	But actually... The commander is still on the line...
