/Dier	Hello!! Can you hear me? And see and feel properly?
/UMP9	Yeah. I'm in... A blue cyberspace.
/Dier	Alright, that means it's working properly.
msg	This simulator is designed to put you in many different environments to test your skills.
msg	It's based on the neural cloud data of most of Sangvis Ferri and your missions as 404.
/UMP9	Woah, cool.
/Dier	Dandelai here is working hard to keep it running. At least, I think she's working hard. Her expression hasn't changed at all.

/Dandelion	I'm currently using about 35% of my computational power.

/UMP45	Is this safe?
/Dier	...We have no idea?
/UMP45	/hl[2]Of course you don't. If she gets deleted it's half a million credits, alright?

/Dier	It's safe, right Dande?
/Dandelion	I'm not going to audit the simulator you wrote. But currently, it seems to be working without issue.
/Dier	Of course. I did test it often enough with my A-Dolls, so it should be pretty stable.
/UMP9	Exactly how much testing is 'often enough'? You know what, I don't want to know. Why is my gun so light?
/Dier	It's a raygun in the shape of a UMP9. It can fire three shots at a time, but it recharges very quickly so don't worry about having to find ammo.
/UMP9	Hey, that's pretty cool!

msg	/dim[0]Just then, someone kicked the door open and a small army of black haired androids poured in.
/Sangvis Doll	Hey, hey, we wanna watch! We heard we're being featured in the simulator!
/G11	waaah, it's so crowded now...
/Dandelion	Do what you want as long as you don't bother me.
/Dier	I'm glad this room is big enough to fit 50 people... Now then. Who here has played Mega Man?
/Everyone	...
/Dier	Right, none of you play video games... Anyways, pick the stage and boss you want to fight and have fun!
