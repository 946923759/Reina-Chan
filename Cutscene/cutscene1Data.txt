msg	The year is 21XX. In some alternate universe G&K still exists, everything's settled down, and 404 was able to live the rest of their days happily at the G&K base.
msg	One day, Dandelai and Dier teamed up to build a new battle simulator as thanks for 404 helping out the AR Team and the commander all the time.
msg	Since the Griffin commander decided to go on a much needed vacation, Dandelai was left in charge.

nop	portrait	pic_UMP9
nop	Automatically highlight portrait with a matching name. Since names are translated by the engine there is no need to change them when translating it into another language (refer to languages.csv)
nop	This is based on order of the matchnames command, so UMP45 = portrait at position 0, UMP9 = portrait at position 1, Dier = Portrait at position 2

speaker	Dier
msg	Alright, just a few more edits...
speaker	UMP45
msg	Don't you think she's going to go through your files?
speaker	Dier
msg	I guess. It's worth it for being able to use the fastest processor in the world though.
msg	Dandelai can process about thirty times as much in parallel as the average T-Doll.
speaker	Dandelai
msg	I already have gone through his computer.
msg	It seems like Dier enjoys purchasing expensive clothing for his A-Dolls and taking pictures... I do not understand this kind of hobby.
speaker	Dier
msg	Did you have to bring that up?! Besides, there's nothing harmful about it!
speaker	UMP45
msg	Yeah, we already knew he's got... Unique tastes. We try to keep G11 away from him since he has four of her model at home.
speaker	Dandelai
msg	Unique? I'm sorry, I do not understand the meaning.
speaker	UMP45
msg	It means he only has eyes for androids. Don't worry Dandelai, you're too human for his tastes.
speaker	Dier
msg	Do you enjoy teasing your benefactor? Let's go back to the simulator, we're getting off track. Who wants to go first?
speaker	UMP9
msg	I'll go! It sounds fun!
speaker	Dier
msg	Alright. Dande, are you ready?
speaker	Dandelai
msg	Yes.
speaker	Dier
msg	Okay then! UMP9, you'll want to sit down in that chair. Unless you want to fall over when Dandelai pulls your neural cloud into the simulator.
speaker	UMP9
msg	Got it.
speaker	Dier
msg	All ready? 3... 2... 1... Let's go!"
